# Get Next Line - Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious 📄

This project aims to implement a function in C that reads a line from a file descriptor. This function should handle various buffer sizes efficiently and manage memory properly to avoid leaks. It also must work seamlessly with both files and standard input.
It’s a fundamental yet powerful utility to my collection of C functions. Through this project, I have also explored and implemented the concept of static variables, which are essential for maintaining state between function calls.

🗣️ " I checked all the tests following the evaluation sheet, no fails. I also checked for memory leaks in some of the tests and, no leaks. He also explained me his logic and answered questions. I also checked on the .h for the def of BUFFER_SIZE, its ok. Thank you for the evaluation and for your time! Congrats for the good work. "
